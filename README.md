# Vital Records:

\* To play Midi in the Chrome Browser by accessing the local file, the Chrome
browser must be set as follows:

\- Copy the chrome.exe access shortcut and make it like this

\- "..\\yourChromePath\\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files

\- For computer security, it is better for only those responsible to use this.

\* In order for chrome to sing midi songs in the form of .mid or .midi or .kar
you have to install it

"virtualMIDISynth" and the best is currently version 1.8, the above version is
rather runny, and can

downloaded at http://coolsoft-virtualmidisynth.software.informer.com/1.8/.

follow the instructions and finally you are asked to access the soundfont and
the soundfont you can

the best choice is "FluidR3 GM2-2.SF2" which is approximately 141.47MB in size
and can be downloaded at:

http://www.synthfont.com/SoundFonts/FluidR3_GM.sfArk but you bother again to
uncompress,

so you can just download it directly at:
https://github.com/mrahtz/musical-pattern-recognition-in-spiking-neural-networks/,
here you will get the FluidR3 GM2-2.SF2 file
